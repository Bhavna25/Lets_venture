 1. Focus on the job listing section and its functionality rather than header and footer. Advanced Search should load the advanced filters only on click. Applying the filters should sort the jobs so that the most recently published job shows up at the top. 
2. You can enter the Job details manually via the back-end. UI should be built only for the search part only.
